In the eastern US, the wildland–urban interface (WUI), where wildfire risk is greatest, has expanded tremendously over the last three decades.

WUI wildfires in the eastern US comprised 45% of all large wildfires and 55% of the area burned, were on average 46% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and are becoming more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire number and area burned occurred outside of the WUI. The WUI plays an important role in large wildfire dynamics in the eastern US; however, increases in the number of large wildfires have occurred primarily outside the WUI.

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large wildfires are increasing in the eastern United States; however, what factors are heightening large wildfire risk remains unclear. Increases in fuel loads from woody encroachment and canopy infilling have been associated with increasing wildfire risk in other US regions. Understanding if and where woody cover increases wildfire risk can help direct proactive fuels management. We characterize multi-scale changes in woody cover through time and assess the relationship between woody cover and large wildfire (>200 ha) occurrence in the eastern US between 1990 and 2020. We found a 37% increase in woody cover across the eastern US, with increases occurring in every ecoregion. The odds of large wildfire increased as woody cover increased in most central and southern ecoregions, where large wildfires were typically more likely in areas with high woody cover (70%–100% cover). Our findings suggest fuels management will be an important tool for reducing large wildfire risk.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As urbanization continues, animals are increasingly compelled to navigate human-altered environments. Here we investigate wildlife use of stormwater sewer systems (SSS), a widespread, subterranean environment resulting from urbanization. We used camera traps to reveal how wildlife exploit subterranean pathways, shedding light on their presence within this anthropogenic context in Alachua County, Florida. From February to May 2023, we documented a total of 35 species of vertebrates within SSS, including amphibians, reptiles, and birds, although mammals dominated our sample. Raccoons and Southeastern Myotis accounted for more than half of all observations, signifying their prevalence and widespread presence within SSS. Our research offers a comprehensive exploration of vertebrate diversity within an unconventional urban habitat and provides valuable insights into the relationship between SSS and species utilization patterns. Ultimately, our research lays the groundwork for future studies and informs the development of ecologically conscientious urban planning strategies.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

In this webinar, we will explore large wildfire patterns inside and outside the WUI and the factors driving these patterns over the past three decades in the eastern U.S. Although the WUI only covers 22% of this region by area, it plays a crucial role in large wildfire dynamics. We found that environmental factors—particularly higher woody cover and drier conditions—and, to a lesser extent, social factors, influence where wildfires occur in and near the WUI.

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Wildfire risk is changing across the globe. We provide a summary of ongoing investigations into changes in large (>200 ha) wildfire activity across multiple scales in the eastern U.S. and the interacting factors affecting wildfire risk. We found shifting wildfire regime characteristics across south and central ecoregions in the east that include increasing wildfire number, size, and annual occurrence, along with changes in wildfire seasonality. Human ignitions started most wildfires in the eastern U.S., though in the Southern Coastal Plain, the majority of area burned was caused by naturally started wildfires. Just under half of all wildfires burned within the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), where the greatest risk to human life and property from wildfires exists. However, increasing trends in large wildfire are largely occurring outside the WUI. We find factors such as suppression potential, weather conditions, and fuels influence this dynamic. We also identified long-term increases in woody cover across eastern ecoregions, linking higher levels of woody cover to heightened wildfire risk in multiple locations. Further investigations find that climate-woody cover interactions strongly predict large wildfire occurrence across numerous eastern ecoregions.

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Large wildfires are increasing in the eastern U.S., which contains the greatest amount of wildland-urban interface (WUI) compared to the rest of the country. Wildfires in and near the WUI pose the greatest risk to human life and property. However, the spatial relationship between large wildfires and the WUI in the eastern U.S., as well as which factors drive these patterns, remains unclear. Using large wildfire (>200 ha) data from 1991 and 2021, we (1) assessed the spatial relationships of large wildfires relative to the WUI and (2) modeled these relationships using a variety of social and environmental variables at multiple spatial scales. Specifically, we assessed wildfire WUI status (intersecting or outside the WUI), distance to WUI, and proportion of WUI area burned.

We found that fewer large wildfires burned in the WUI compared to randomly selected locations within the study region. Wildfires that intersected the WUI burned either a very small or very large proportion of the WUI; however, wildfires outside the WUI burned closer to it than expected by chance. At the largest spatial scale, our global model containing weather, fuel, ignition, and suppression-related variables best explained the relationship between wildfires and the WUI. Overall, wildfires in the WUI burned in areas with higher woody cover, more suppression resources nearby, higher road density, lower precipitation, lower wind speed, and during times when suppression resources were more strained than wildfires outside the WUI. As wildfires burned a greater proportion of the WUI, these trends were heightened. Large wildfires that burned closer to the WUI had higher woody cover, higher road density, and lower fuel moisture. At the regional scale, significantly correlated factors driving these relationships varied among eastern ecoregions, suggesting regionally context-dependent wildfire risk. Our findings highlight the need for region-specific wildfire risk management and improved fire suppression planning.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

Woody cover increases linked to forest infilling and land conversion in the eastern United States. <i>International Association for Landscape Ecology - North America Annual Conference</i>.</div>
</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Woody cover increases in historically open ecosystems are occurring across the globe, leading to ecosystem degradation and increased wildfire risk. Tree and shrub cover is increasing in the eastern United States, which historically was dominated by open forest ecosystems; however, it is still unclear whether recent woody cover increases are due to infilling, linked to ecosystem degradation due to fire suppression, or to land use changes such as conversion of croplands to commercial pine plantations. Understanding the nature of recent woody cover increases is essential for identifying and addressing potential risks to ecosystem function and human activities. Using remotely sensed data, we quantified woody cover changes from 2001 to 2021 across land use types and compared the relative contribution of infilling and land-use conversion to increasing woody cover trends. We found that although overall forest cover had decreased, remaining forests became denser, especially deciduous forests. This infilling contributed the majority of increasing woody cover on the landscape. However, the conversion of non-forested land-cover types to evergreen forests was also a significant contributor to increasing woody cover on the landscape, especially in the southern half of the region. Our findings suggest that forest infilling is the greatest contributor to increasing woody cover in the eastern U.S., suggesting the continued degradation of fire-dependent open forests in the eastern U.S.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Wildfires are increasing in the eastern United States. The wildland-urban interface (WUI), which occurs at the intersection between human development and wildland vegetative fuels, remains the focus for predicting and mitigating wildfire risk. Wildfires in the WUI require more resources to suppress, destroy more homes, and pose a greater threat to human life. The eastern U.S. contains a disproportionately large amount of the WUI compared to other parts of the country, making it crucial to characterize differences between WUI and non-WUI wildfire regime changes. We contrast spatial and temporal characteristics of WUI versus non-WUI wildfire regimes across Level III ecoregions in the eastern U.S. using decadal WUI maps from 1990 to 2020 combined with large wildfire perimeter data and ignition source data from 1986 to 2021. We found that a substantial proportion of wildfires occurred in the WUI (45%), even though the WUI only makes up 22% of the eastern U.S. by area. The number of wildfires, mean area burned, and total area burned increased both inside and outside the WUI in most ecoregions. The primary source of wildfire ignitions in the WUI was arson and, secondarily, natural causes (lightning). The results of this study highlight the increasing risk of large wildfires in the eastern U.S. and can be used to help support informed decision-making surrounding wildfire risk management in the region.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

While addressing the recent rise in both the frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe is relevant, it is unclear whether this paper makes a significant contribution to this effort. A primary concern is that much of the language throughout the letter is unclear and requires numerous changes to improve the flow and readability of the manuscript. Additionally, this manuscript is rather long and winding making it difficult to follow. A key missing piece upon reading the paper is why the authors specifically choose to focus on these two approaches and why do they argue they need to be integrated? It is difficult to assess the validity for the paper since it is unclear what the justification is for the integration of the approaches. Overall, the current version requires substantial revision to clarify their arguments, reduce repetitive language, and improve of the general flow of the manuscript.</p></details></div><div class="type-heading">Media Coverage</div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">

</div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As development continues to expand into fire-prone landscapes, the eastern United States is experiencing notable shifts in wildfire patterns. Weidig and colleagues analyzed four decades of wildfire records to examine how large wildfire dynamics have changed across eastern ecoregions, with a particular focus on the wildland-urban interface (WUI)–areas where homes and wildlands meet. The study assessed trends in wildfire size, frequency, and seasonality both within and outside the WUI, providing new insights into how changing land use and fire weather are reshaping fire regimes in this land-use type.

The authors found that wildfire activity has increased across much of the eastern U.S., with the number of wildfires having grown over time–especially in the southeastern coastal plain. Nearly half of all recorded wildfires across the eastern U.S. occurred within the WUI, most of which occurred in the Central Appalachian region. While these WUI fires pose the greatest threat to human life and property, the most extensive fires typically occurred outside of developed areas. The southeastern coastal plain saw the most large wildfires occur outside the WUI, yet most wildfires within and outside the WUI in the region were human-caused. The timing of wildfires also shifted, with more fires occurring earlier and later in the year–indicating a lengthening fire season. These trends suggest that interactions among vegetation growth, human development, and changing weather conditions are driving more frequent and widespread wildfires in the eastern U.S.

For fire managers in the southern region, this study supports the use of prescribed fire as a proactive tool for reducing fuel loads and mitigating wildfire risk near expanding communities. As fire seasons lengthen and weather windows for prescribed burning become less predictable, managers may need to adopt more flexible and adaptive approaches to maintain desired fire frequencies. Moreover, the finding that most wildfire ignitions in the southeast are human-caused underscores the value of cross-jurisdictional coordination and community outreach in the WUI to promote fire-adapted landscapes. Nevertheless, continued application of prescribed fire remains essential for sustaining ecosystem resilience and reducing the potential for catastrophic wildfires.</p></details></div><div class="entry"><div class="csl-bib-body" style="line-height: 2; padding-left: 1em; text-indent:-1em;">
